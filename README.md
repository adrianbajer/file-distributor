# File-distributor
Application designed for one of the tourist publishing houses. It facilitates management of the file flow in publishing process.

How it works?
User selects code of a product/publication, then the application finds names of corresponding graphic files in a database.
User may display that data, view them on a map or download an excel file with that data. It is possible to update database by inserting data in an excel file and uploading it in the application.
