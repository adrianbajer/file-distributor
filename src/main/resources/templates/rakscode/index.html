    <p style=margin-top:-25px;> Application for searching and downloading files. Designed for use in the cartography department in one of the major tourist publishing houses.<br>
        It facilitates management of the file flow in publishing process.</p><br>

    <p style="margin-top:-25px; font-weight: bold;";>How it works?</p>
    <p style=margin-top:-10px;>
        Files are marked by a code called RAKS code. Application diplays a form where user selects RAKS code, name and type of job. Basing on user's input<br>
        and data stored in the application code, application finds corresponding files, copies them to selected directory or displays their data. <br>
        Additionally it creates an excel file where necessary data are saved (who and for what purpose has downloaded files).<br>
